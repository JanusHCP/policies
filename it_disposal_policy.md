# IT Disposal Policy

Janus Healthcare Partners utilizes a dedicated IT to dispose of all physical IT assets (employee workstations) that have reached the end of their lifespan.  Note: all sensitive data is stored on cloud servers hosted by AWS and not on local workstation hard drives.  Use of removeable media or external hard drives is explicitly prohibited.

## Key Definitions:
Non-Viable Workstation - A workstation that has reached the end of its working life

## IT Disposal Requirements

1. All non-viable workstations are promptly returned to the dedicated IT team
2. All software licenses are uninstalled, and employee access is removed by the IT team from the non-viable workstation
3. The non-viable workstation hard drive is re-imaged clearing it of any data
4. The non-viable workstation is recycled as is required by local law

## IT Asset Review Policy

All Janus HCP physical IT assets (employee workstations) are reviewed on an annual basis under the direction of the CTO.  Assets are assessed for damage and wear.  Assets that are deemed to be non-viable are replaced and disposed of as dictated by the IT Disposal Requirements.
