# HIPAA Compliance Policies

Our policies have been written with modern, cloud-based technology vendors in mind. We looked far and wide for policy 
examples that fit our company, and couldn't find any. So we wrote our own. Importantly, these policies have been through 
three external audits--two HIPAA audits, and one HITRUST audit.
