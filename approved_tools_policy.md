# Approved Tools Policy

Janus Healthcare Partners utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by Janus Healthcare Partners, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity. Use of other tools requires approval from Janus Healthcare Partners leadership.

Janus Healthcare Partners does not permit the use of any external public services for the sharing of protected data.

Use of external public services, such as instant messages and file sharing, are explicitly prohibited.  Janus HCP workforce members are only permitted to use pre-approved software tools selected by the CTO
