# Approved Tools Policy

Janus Healthcare Partners utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by Janus Healthcare Partners, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity. Use of other tools requires approval from Janus Healthcare Partners leadership.

Janus Healthcare Partners does not permit the use of any external public services for the sharing of protected data.

## External Tool Approval Policy
Use of external public services, such as instant messages and file sharing, without approval from the CTO is explicitly prohibited.  Janus HCP workforce members are only permitted to use approved software tools selected by the CTO.

1. Janus workforce members can seek the approval of the CTO to use an external public tool if there is an imperative business need not already satisfied by an existing software tool
2. It is the responsibility of the CTO to assess all security risks imposed by the external facing tool
3. It is the responsibility of the CTO to prioritize any needed work to mitigate security risks imposed by the external facing tool
4. Any external facing tools are promptly decommissioned once the applicable business need ceases to be relevant.
