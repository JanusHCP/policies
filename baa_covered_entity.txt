I. DEFINITIONS.  For the purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below.  All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning ascribed to them by HIPAA. 
	
	a. “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” is any information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium that is created, received, maintained, or transmitted by Business Associate for or on behalf of Covered Entity, that identifies an individual or might reasonably be used to identify an individual and relates to: (i) the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health; (ii) the provision of health care to the individual; or (iii) the past, present or future payment for health care.

In addition, Service Provider may use PHI to create de-­identified information in a manner consistent with the standards set forth in HIPAA.
		
	ii. Subject to the restrictions set forth throughout this Agreement, Business Associate may use the information received from Covered Entity if necessary for (a) the proper management and administration of Business Associate; or (b) to carry out the legal responsibilities of Business Associate.
