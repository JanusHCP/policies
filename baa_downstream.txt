VI. 	Term and Termination.  

		A)	General Term and Termination

		This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date set forth above and shall terminate upon the termination or expiration of the Service Agreement and when all PHI provided by either party to the other, or created or received or transmitted or maintained by Service Provider on behalf of Company is, in accordance with Section VII below, destroyed or returned to Company or, if it is not feasible to return or destroy PHI, protections are extended to such information, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

		B) 	Material breach

		Where either Party has knowledge of a material breach by the other Party, and cure is possible, the non-breaching Party shall provide the breaching Party with written notice of such breach and ten (10) business days to cure such breach.  If the breaching party does not cure such breach, the non-breaching party may then terminate this BAA and all portion(s) of the Service Agreement affected by the breach, if feasible.  

		Where either Party has knowledge of a material breach by the other Party and cure is not possible, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement and portion(s) of the Service Agreement affected by the breach, if feasible.  
   
VII. 	Return/Destruction of PHI Upon Termination 

		Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Service Provider shall, at Company’s election, return or destroy all PHI.  This provision shall also apply to PHI in the possession of subcontractors or agents of Service Provider.  Service Provider shall retain no copies of the PHI.

		Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Service Provider reasonably determines that returning or destroying the Protected Health Information is infeasible, Service Provider shall provide to Company notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Parties, not to be unreasonably withheld, that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, Service Provider shall extend the protections of this BAA to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as Service Provider maintains such PHI.
 
VIII. 	Indemnification.  

		Service Provider shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, subcontractors, employees, affiliates, agents, and representatives from and against any and all third party liabilities, costs, claims, suits, actions, proceedings, demands, losses and liabilities of any kind (including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by and/or brought by a third party, arising from or relating to the acts and/or omissions of Service Provider and/or any of its directors, officers, subcontractors, employees, affiliates, agents, and representatives in connection with Service Provider’s performance under this Agreement or Service Agreement, without regard to any limitation or exclusion of damages provision otherwise set forth in the Agreement. The indemnification provisions of this Section VIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

IX. 	Regulatory References.
	
		A reference in this BAA to a section in HIPAA means the section as in effect or as amended from time to time, and for which compliance is required.

X.		 Amendment.  

		If any of the regulations promulgated under HIPAA or the HITECH Act are amended or interpreted in a manner that renders this Agreement inconsistent therewith, the Parties shall promptly amend this Agreement to the extent necessary to comply with such amendments or interpretations. 

XI. 	Conflicting Terms.  

		In the event any terms of this Agreement conflict with any terms of the Service Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control.

XII.	Interpretation.  
	
		Any ambiguity in this BAA shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the parties to comply with applicable law, including HIPAA.

XII. 	Notices.

		All notices, requests, approvals, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered either personally, or by certified mail with postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by overnight courier to the party to be notified.
