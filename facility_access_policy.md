# Facility Access Policy

BloomAPI works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the BloomAPI Platform. BloomAPI and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which BloomAPI workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of BloomAPI facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to BloomAPI's facility.

BloomAPI does not store any confidential information in BloomAPI facilities, nor does BloomAPI house any systems that serve confidential information in BloomAPI facilities. ePHI and confidential data is exclusively stored on secured servers and databases hosted within Google Cloud Platform, which is secured according to their access control policies [here](https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/). These include live video monitoring, human security patrols, rigorous access control, etc.
