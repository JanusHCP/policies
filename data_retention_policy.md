# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Janus Health Partners understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Janus Health Partners is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Janus Health Partners has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Janus Health Partners Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws
