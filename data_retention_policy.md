# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Janus Health Partners understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Janus Health Partners is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Janus Health Partners has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Janus Health Partners Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Janus Health Partners Customers have data stored by Janus Health Partners as a part of the Janus Health Partners Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are 
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Janus Health Partners.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Janus Health Partners within 30 days, Janus Health Partners may remove data from Janus Health Partners systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
